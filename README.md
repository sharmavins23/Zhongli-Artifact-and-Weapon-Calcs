# Zhongli Artifact and Weapon Calcs

This project is a small artifact and weapon calculator, which calculates all of
Zhongli's possible weapons and artifacts and saves their stats in a data-driven
format.

## Usage

In the command line, you can type `python script.py` in order to run the script.
It runs through all data and calculates the maximal values for each weapon.

To change the weapons that are being calculated, or show separate data, simply
change the list contents in the top of the `Calling code` section. Then,
uncomment the bottom portion that prints out to `dataOut.json` the total JSON
data. This will print out ALL values, instead of just the maximal values.

# To-Do List

-   Re-do weapon classes with dynamic attack and stat calculations based on
    level and refinement
-   Re-do weapon classes with attributes to enable or disable stacking
-   Re-do character data with dynamic stat calculations based on level, talent
    level
